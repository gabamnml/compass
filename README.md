## Disclaimers
```
Routes and tracks are sets of GPS information designed to help you in your navigation. There are a few key differences to keep in mind when using routes and tracks.

Routes are pre-defined paths created from a group of location points entered into the GPS receiver in the sequence you desire to navigate them.
Location points can be user generated waypoints or points of interest that have been loaded from a map or from a Garmin program
Routes are created on the computer and/or on the device
Tracks act like breadcrumb trails, allowing you to see where you or another individual traveled in the past. This allows you to navigate a path previously taken.
Tracks contain track points, not waypoints or points of interest
There are two different types of tracks:
Active Track Log:
Contains track points for your current activity
Can be cleared at the start of a new activity
Can be set to wrap around (overwrite older track points as device runs out of memory)
Can be saved as a “Saved Track”
Saved Tracks:
Created typically from the active track log
Can have a limit to the maximum amount of track points based on the device (for example: 250, 500, 10,000 track points maximum)
Creation can result in points being consolidated (on device) or truncated (from computer to device) depending on the source, to meet above device track point limitations
Creation can result in data removal based on the device (for example: date, time, speed and accessory data)
